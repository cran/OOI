Description: 
  Calculates the Outside Option Index proposed by Caldwell and Danieli
  (2018) <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-uwD19S4gqgXIXeYch9jGBCaDhWZlRQ/view>. 
  This index uses the cross- sectional concentration of similar workers 
  across job types to quantify the availability of outside options as a function of 
  workersâ€™ characteristics (e.g. commuting costs, preferences, and skills.)
